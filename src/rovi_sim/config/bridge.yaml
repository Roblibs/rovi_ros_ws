# ros_gz_bridge config for rovi_sim
#
# This simulation intentionally keeps the ROS-side contract the same as the real robot:
# - /cmd_vel input (from twist_mux) -> rovi_sim_base -> Gazebo (/model/rovi/cmd_vel)
# - /clock bridged from Gazebo to ROS for use_sim_time
# - /scan + /imu + /camera/*/image bridged by rovi_gz_sensors_bridge_node with stable frame IDs
# - ground-truth odometry bridged from Gazebo as /odom_gz (adapted to /odom_raw by rovi_gz_odom)
